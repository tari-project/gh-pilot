//! The rule_set module is a wrapper around a Vec of [`Rules`] with added functionality to (eventually) read in rules
//! from JSON, YAML, etc. so that the server can be configured without needing to recompile it every time.
//!
//! We maintain a vector of rules because order is important. Rules are run in the order that they are defined.
